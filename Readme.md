#### React-Apps

This repo contains basic react apps for beginners. To create a new react app, you can use the `create-react-app.sh` script which will help you setup a new React Project

This script does the following
- Installs create-react-app globally
- Creates a new react app with the name you provide
- Sets up Typescript, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI, and the folder structure

```bash
bash create-react-app.sh <app-name>
```
